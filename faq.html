We review every note in the chart, including physician entries, nursing updates, labs, imaging, and medication administration records. We visit patients at the bedside several times per week, spending hours at a time to monitor progress, clarify care plans, and communicate directly with medical teams. We advocate proactively, ensuring that hospital stays or rehabilitation programs are extended when medically justified, and that discharge plans are safe, appropriate, and aligned with the patient's goals and beliefs. In short, we quarterback the patient's care, connecting all moving parts of the hospital system to serve one central purpose: the patient's best interest."
